About SmartThyroid® 

In creating ablood DNA-based test, we sought to incorporate the most discriminating andinformative biomarkers to ensure the highest possible sensitivity in detectingthyroid cancer. The test includes a protein biomarker (calcitonin), 8 distinct DNApoint mutation biomarkers (BRAF,N-RAS, H-RAS, MACF1, HMCN1, DNM1P47, BDP1, KMT2A gene), and 5 differentDNA methylation biomarkers (SHOX2,SEPT9, ZNF132, APC, TP53) and 1 additional negative control. In thepatent, we will confirm that the appropriate amount of blood DNA is analyzed ineach individual sample. This multi-marker approach is a distinguishing featureof our scientific platform.
Abovemarkers will be discussed again to make sure they are the best biomarkers.
